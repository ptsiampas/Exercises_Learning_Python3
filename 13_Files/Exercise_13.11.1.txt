You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together,
but do so with all your heart.

to enjoy, to love.

arm you against the present.

He who lives in harmony with himself lives in harmony with the universe.
