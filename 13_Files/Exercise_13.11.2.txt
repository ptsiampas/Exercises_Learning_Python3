Snakes consume a variety of items including termites, rodents, birds, frogs, small deer and other reptiles.
Snakes eat their prey whole and are able to consume prey three times larger than the diameter of their head
because their lower jaw can separate from the upper jaw. To keep prey from escaping, snakes have rear-facing
teeth that hold their prey in their mouths.

Venomous snakes inject their prey with venom, while constrictors squeeze their prey.
They do not need to hunt everyday.
Anacondas and pythons can survive for up to a year without food after feeding.
Snakes hunt mostly at night.
