# 5. Given four points that fall on the circumference of a circle, find the midpoint of the circle.
# When will you function fail?
#
# Hint: You must know how to solve the geometry problem before you think of going
# anywhere near programming. You cannot program a solution to a problem if you donâ€™t
# understand what you want the computer to do!
