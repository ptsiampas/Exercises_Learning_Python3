# 5. Your traffic light controller program has been patented, and youâ€™re about to become seriously rich. But your
# new client needs a change. They want four states in their state machine: Green, then Green and Orange together,
# then Orange only, and then Red. Additionally, they want different times spent in each state. The machine should
# spend 3 seconds in the Green state, followed by one second in the Green+Orange state, then one second in the
# Orange state, and then 2 seconds in the Red state. Change the logic in the state machine.
