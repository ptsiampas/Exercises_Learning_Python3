## Exercises Completed
1. Open help for the calendar module.
    a. Prints out the year as specified in `cal.pryear(<year>)`
    b. use the following `cal.setfirstweekday(calendar.THURSDAY)` to set what day to start the calendar on.
    c. Use the following `cal.prmonth(1968, 5)` which is `prmonth(year, month)
    d. This gave an error saying the locale was not supported. Because I didn't install it for Spanish
    e. Expects the year for which you want tested, and returns if its True or false.
    
2. Open help for the math module.
    a. 48ish, not going to count them.
    b. `math.ceil` rounds up and `math.floor` rounds down a float number.
    c. we have been using `**.05`
    d. the two data constants are pi (`math.pi`) and e (`math.e`)
    
3. Investigate the `copy` module. 
    a. *What does deepcopy do?* deep copy will duplicate the the entire array including sub arrays, normal copy only
       copies the first level of the array.
    b. *In which exercises from last chapter would deepcopy have come in handy?* No Idea. :/
4. Completed.
5. You only see the print statement when `mymodule1.py` is run only.
6. This is what tim Peters has to say.
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
7. I did this in the previous chapter, but improved it so that it passes the second test. (Exercise_12.11.7)
8. Completed. wordtools.py
