## My Notes

## Exercises Completed
1. Open help for the calendar module.

    a. Prints out the year as specified in `cal.pryear(<year>)`
    
    b. use the following `cal.setfirstweekday(calendar.THURSDAY)` to set what day to start the calendar on.
    
    c. Use the following `cal.prmonth(1968, 5)` which is `prmonth(year, month)
    
    d. This gave an error saying the locale was not supported. Because I didn't install it for Spanish
    
    e. Expects the year for which you want tested, and returns if its True or false.
    
2. Open help for the math module.

    a. 48ish, not going to count them.
    
    b. `math.ceil` rounds up and `math.floor` rounds down a float number.
    
    c. we have been using `**.05`
    
    d. the two data constants are pi (`math.pi`) and e (`math.e`)
    
3. Investigate the `copy` module. 

    a. *What does deepcopy do?* deep copy will duplicate the the entire array including sub arrays, normal copy only
       copies the first level of the array.
       
    b. *In which exercises from last chapter would deepcopy have come in handy?*
