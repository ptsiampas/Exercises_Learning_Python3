# 11.22. Exercises
1. What is the Python interpreter’s response to the following?

```python
list(range(10, 0, -2))
```
    - The three arguments to the range function are `start`, `stop`, and `step,` respectively. In this example, `start` is greater than `stop`. What happens `if start < stop and step < 0`? Write a rule for the relationships among `start`, `stop`, and `step`.

2. Consider this fragment of code:

```python
import turtle

tess = turtle.Turtle()
alex = tess
alex.color("hotpink")
```

    - Does this fragment create one or two turtle instances? Does setting the color of alex also change the color of tess? Explain in detail.

3. Draw a state snapshot for a and b before and after the third line of the following Python code is executed:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a[:]
b[0] = 5
```

4. What will be the output of the following program?

```python
this = ["I", "am", "not", "a", "crook"]
that = ["I", "am", "not", "a", "crook"]
print("Test 1: {0}".format(this is that))
that = this
print("Test 2: {0}".format(this is that))
```

    - Provide a detailed explanation of the results.

5. Lists can be used to represent mathematical vectors. In this exercise and several that follow you will write functions to perform standard operations on vectors. Create a script named `vectors.py` and write Python code to pass the tests in each case.

    - Write a function `add_vectors(u, v)` that takes two lists of numbers of the same length, and returns a new list containing the sums of the corresponding elements of each:

```python
test(add_vectors([1, 1], [1, 1]), [2, 2])
test(add_vectors([1, 2], [1, 4]), [2, 6])
test(add_vectors([1, 2, 1], [1, 4, 3]), [2, 6, 4])
```
6. Write a function scalar_mult(s, v) that takes a number, s, and a list, v and returns the scalar multiple of v by s. :

```python
test(scalar_mult(5, [1, 2]), [5, 10])
test(scalar_mult(3, [1, 0, -1]), [3, 0, -3])
test(scalar_mult(7, [3, 0, 5, 11, 2]), [21, 0, 35, 77, 14])
```

7. Write a `function dot_product(u, v)` that takes two lists of numbers of the same length, and returns the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of each (the dot_product).

```python
test(dot_product([1, 1], [1, 1]),  2)
test(dot_product([1, 2], [1, 4]),  9)
test(dot_product([1, 2, 1], [1, 4, 3]), 12)
```

Extra challenge for the mathematically inclined: Write a function cross_product(u, v) that takes two lists of numbers of length 3 and returns their cross product. You should write your own tests.

Describe the relationship between " ".join(song.split()) and song in the fragment of code below. Are they the same for all strings assigned to song? When would they be different?

```python
song = "The rain in Spain..."
```

Write a function replace(s, old, new) that replaces all occurrences of old with new in a string s:

```python
test(replace("Mississippi", "i", "I"), "MIssIssIppI")

s = "I love spom! Spom is my favorite food. Spom, spom, yum!"
test(replace(s, "om", "am"),
    "I love spam! Spam is my favorite food. Spam, spam, yum!")

test(replace(s, "o", "a"),
    "I lave spam! Spam is my favarite faad. Spam, spam, yum!")
```

Hint: use the split and join methods.

Suppose you want to swap around the values in two variables. You decide to factor this out into a reusable function, and write this code:

```python
def swap(x, y):      # Incorrect version
     print("before swap statement: x:", x, "y:", y)
     (x, y) = (y, x)
     print("after swap statement: x:", x, "y:", y)

a = ["This", "is", "fun"]
b = [2,3,4]
print("before swap function call: a:", a, "b:", b)
swap(a, b)
print("after swap function call: a:", a, "b:", b)
```

Run this program and describe the results. Oops! So it didn’t do what you intended! Explain why not. Using a Python visualizer like the one at http://netserv.ict.ru.ac.za/python3_viz may help you build a good conceptual model of what is going on. What will be the values of a and b after the call to swap?
